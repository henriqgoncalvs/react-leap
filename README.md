# React Leap üöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ

## Introduction

After building many applications, I decided to create an example project that implements the best tools I use to build robust, scalable and production ready applications.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a collection of good practices when developing React applications. It is supposed to showcase solving most of the real-world problems of an application in a practical way and help developers writing better applications.

Feel free to explore the codebase to get the most value out of the repo.

#### Disclaimer:

This project is heavily based on [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react). It's an awesome project build by an awesome developer named [Alan Alickovic](https://github.com/alan2207), you should definetly take a look.

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and be consistent with your style.
